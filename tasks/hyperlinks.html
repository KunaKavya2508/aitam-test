    <h1>BRICS</h1>
    <p><u>BRICS</u> is an intergovernmental organization comprising nine countries <b>Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, </b>Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. BRICS was originally identified to highlight investment opportunities.[3] The grouping evolved into a geopolitical bloc, with their governments meeting annually at formal summits and coordinating multilateral policies since 2009. Relations among BRICS are conducted mainly based on non-interference, equality, and mutual benefit.[4]</p>
